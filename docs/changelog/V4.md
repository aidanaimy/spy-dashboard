# V4.0 - The "Volatility Harvester" Pivot
**Date:** November 29, 2025
**Status:** PLANNING

## 🚨 The Pivot
Robustness testing revealed that the V3 complex signal logic was **not predictive** (Null Hypothesis Test: Actual < Random). The system's true edge lies in:
1.  **Regime Detection:** Identifying "FAVORABLE" days.
2.  **Risk Management:** Asymmetric TP/SL (80/40 or 100/35).
3.  **Market Conditions:** High Volatility / Bear Markets.

V4 strips away the complexity to focus purely on this structural edge.

## ✅ V4 Todo List

### 1. Core Logic Overhaul
- [ ] **Gut `generate_signal`:** Remove VWAP/EMA/Candle pattern complexity.
- [ ] **Implement Simple Entry:** Replace with basic "Trend Alignment" (Price > VWAP = Call, Price < VWAP = Put).
- [ ] **Loosen Filters:** Remove restrictive filters that reduce trade frequency on Favorable days.

### 2. Regime & Risk Hardening
- [ ] **Implement "Hard Deck" Rule:** In `regime.py`, return `AVOID` if `VIX < 15`.
- [ ] **Update Parameters:** Change `config.py` to **100% TP / 35% SL** (Grid Search winner).

### 3. Verification
- [ ] **Run Baseline Backtest:** Test V4 logic over the 1-year period.
- [ ] **Target:** Beat V3's $2,573 P/L and approach the theoretical max of ~$3,900.

### 4. Future R&D (Post-Launch)
- [ ] **Explore Gamma Exposure (GEX):** For better chop detection.
- [ ] **Explore Dark Pools:** For better "Favorable" day definition.
